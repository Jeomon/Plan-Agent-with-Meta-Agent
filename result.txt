Entering System Time Agent
Thought: Since the task is to retrieve the current system time, I need to assess the available tools in the tool box. However, upon reviewing the tool box, I realize that there is no tool available to directly retrieve the system time. Therefore, I will request the creation of a new tool to accomplish this task.
Entering Tool Agent
Query: Create a new tool called 'System Time Tool' that can retrieve the current system time. This tool should be able to access the system clock and provide the current time in a readable format.
System Time Tool has been saved to experimental.py successfully.
Tool Name: System Time Tool
Tool Input: {'properties': {'format': {'description': 'The format of the time', 'example': ['%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'], 'title': 'Format', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['format'], 'type': 'object'}
 Tool has been generated successfully. Now the tool is available in the tool box and ready for use.
Thought: Now that the 'System Time Tool' is available in the tool box, I can use it to retrieve the current system time. I will specify the format as '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' to get the time in a readable format.
